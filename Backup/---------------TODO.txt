--> fix up .h structure, hence add extern to global var FILE
--> add rx to change between 1 sensor and all sensors on tx, & to turn all sensors off (new state in FSM + boolean for each sensor, if true for sensor n, then tx)
--> test rx with computer terminal 
--> Add varying sleep states i.e. when all sensors are off sleep
--> adapt app 
--> refactor app 
--> look into making a service
